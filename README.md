# HireRank AI — AI-Powered Candidate Screening Tool

## 🚀 Problem
Recruiters spend hours manually screening high volumes of resumes. This tool automates initial candidate screening using structured scoring and explainable ranking.

## 🧠 Solution
HireRank AI:
- Parses resumes (PDF)
- Extracts skills, experience, education
- Scores against a job description
- Allows adjustable weighting
- Produces ranked shortlist with explanation
- Includes bias audit for fairness transparency

## 🔧 Features
- Resume PDF parsing
- Structured data extraction
- Weighted multi-factor scoring
- Adjustable recruiter preferences
- Transparent explanation layer
- Bias audit system
- Interactive frontend dashboard

## ⚖️ Bias Mitigation
The system explicitly excludes:
- Name
- Gender
- Location
- University prestige
- Age

Only job-relevant factors are considered.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: React + Tailwind  
Backend: Node.js + Express  
Parsing: pdf-parse  
Deployment: (Add Render / Vercel if deployed)

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Semantic matching using embeddings
- ML-based skill weighting
- Resume section parsing using NLP
- Recruiter analytics dashboard
